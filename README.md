# My Brain Capsule

Namespace: van.memory

Summary: This capsule helps people remember things. It remembers anything you tell it, and helps you recall it later. Say where you put something, when you did something, or anything else you can describe.

Detailed Description:

Say something, and this skill will remember it. Ask a question, and you'll hear back the most recent thing you said about it. It recognizes questions when you include a question word, such as who, when, or where. It repeats back the last thing you said that has similar words in it, searching all memories for the words in your question.

Always tells you the most recent thing you said about a topic. So if you need to change something, simply add a new memory, and the new one takes priority.

Helps you manage a growing list of memories and can respond to certain questions or commands, such as:
How many memories are there?
What was the last thing I said?
List all memories.
Forget the last thing I said.
Or, forget all memories.

Will always ask for confirmation before deleting anything.

Your memories are private, but only within your household. Anyone else talking to this skill from your location
will be able to hear these memories, so keep that in mind.
